# Analysis of globl Covid and vaccination data

## Introduction
COrona VIrus Disease 2019 (Covid-19) is a highly contageous respiratory disease caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). 
First case of Covid-19 was identified in Wuhan, China in November 2019. Many Covid-19 cases have symptoms range from asymptomatic (no or mild symptoms) to deadly.
The Covid-19 virus spreads through tiny aroplets of fluid between people in close contact. Due to the highly contageous nature, Covid -19 has spread across the globe within few months of 
identification of the first case and was lethal to indivials with pre-medical conditions and older citizens.
In March 2020, Covid-19 has been declared as global pandemic by World Health Organization (WHO).
